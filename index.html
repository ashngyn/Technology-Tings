<h2><font size="6">Brief Background:</font></h2>
	<p><font size="5">Hello! My name is Ashley Nguyen, and one interesting fact about me is that I like to sleep. Sleep is essentially something that I think is vital to life as you can sleep through the mistakes and troubles in society. I usually sleep around 12-1 AM in the morning and tend to wake up around 10 AM, great 8 hours of sleep am I right folks? Anyway, besides sleeping, I don't like to procrastinate, but it has became a habit of mine. I don't really know what else to put here. I like memes. Especially dead memes and cringy memes. Great resource to fuel your brain cells. Some character traits about me is that I like I am awkward, dead, and somewhat comical? Not sure about the comical part.</font></p>
